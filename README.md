# Prompt Engineering

This assignment requires you to use prompt engineering to improve classification performance 
of a ChatGPT model. This assignments mimics work done as part of a Forestry MS project by 
Madeline Damon. Part of her work was understanding the types of authors who were publishing
in different fields. Part of _that_ is classifying academic articles into groups, a form
of classification modeling.

The folder `data/` includes the file `training-data.csv` that holds the data you'll use for this assignment. In that file you will find about 1000 abstracts, along with categories determined by Madeline and myself. Your goal is to refine a series of ChatGPT prompts that give the most accurate classifications.
